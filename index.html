<h1> Remote Work Technologies: How they disrupt the current work environment </h1>
 </div>

<div class = "intro">
<h2> I. Introduction </h2>
<p> 
 Innovation is a necessity in businesses to thrive in this competitive and ever-changing digital age. 
 In the context of innovation, The Innovator's Dilemma (Christensen 1997) divided innovation into two separate categories 
 based on circumstances: sustaining and disruptive. In sustaining circumstances, the challenge is to create better commodities 
 that can be offered at a higher price to suitable clients for profit. This is where disruptors enter. Disruptors often make a
 similar product but the challenge in disruptive innovation is to market a simpler, and affordable product that is cheaper and
 appeals to new consumers or unattractive customer set. This proves to surpass incumbents who innovate based on sustaining circumstances
 by effectively targeting the overlooked markets since sustaining innovators often concentrate on developing their products and services
 for their most demanding and therefore most profitable consumers only (Christensen, 2015). In this age of technology, disruptive 
 innovations are appearing, and in the field of work, remote works is is one of them.

 Remote working, commonly known as work from home or telecommuting (Gartner, 2020),
 refers to “the practice of an employee working at their home,
 or in some other place that is not an organization’s usual place of business” (Cambridge Dictionary, 2022). In other words,
 it allows employees to work flexibly outside their organization to balance their life and career endeavors.
 It benefits both the employee and the company to achieve greater opportunities and satisfaction. 
 Remote work can be “temporary or permanent, part-time or full-time, occasional or frequent” (Gartner, 2020),
 depending on the policies of the company.

 The COVID-19 pandemic compelled many individuals to swiftly transition from a traditional face-to-face work 
 environment to a wholly remote workforce. Majority of the population are greatly affected by this phenomenon 
 to prevent the widespread of virus. Because of this occurrence in our lives, remote work changed the way people 
 work, eventually creating a technological disruption. Our group decided to exemplify this topic on our report to 
 tackle its relevance in our situation nowadays and why and how it can be considered disruptive. 

</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class = "second">
<h2> II. Why Remote Work Tech can be considered disruptive </h2>
 
 <p> 
 There are many reasons why working from home can be considered disruptive. Perhaps the most obvious reason is that
 it allows people to work from anywhere in the world, which was not possible before. This means that people can now work
 at the comfort of their own home, or from coffee shops, or co-working spaces, or anywhere else as long as they are connected
 to the internet. This type of flexibilty is very appealing to employees.
  </p>
  
  <p>
 In recent years, there has been a growing trend employees working remotely. This is largely thanks to the advances in technology
 which have made it easier for people to stay connected and collaborate no matter where they are in the world.
 However, working from home is not possible for every individual or every type of occupation (Beňo, 2021). Quite often the remote medium of the work
 is determined by the characteristics of the profession itself and can only be implemented in a proportion of all duties (Klopotek, 2017).
 </p>

 <p>
 Remote working can also be disruptive to traditional working arrangements. In the traditional office set-up, most workers
 are based in a central location to work together. Having remote work technology have a number of implications for businesses.
 For instance, they no longer need to provide office space for all their employees. This can lead to significant cost savings, as
 well as a smaller environmental footprint. 
 </p>

 <p>
 Another way in which remote work technology is disruptive is that it changes the way employees interact with each other. In a
 traditional office setting, workers are typically in close proximity with each other and can easily collaborate. With remote work,
 employees are often spread out across different time zones and locations, which can make it more difficult to collaborate.
 </p>

 <p>
 Along with the many benefits of a remote workplace, there are still more obstacles that must be overcome in order to achieve a 
 positive and productive remote working environment.
 </p>

 <p>
 The absence of a reliable routine and structure. It is more difficult to interact and manage the work environment when 
 individuals work in isolated locations far from one another since everyone has different habits and lives at home.
 Remote working can be disruptive due to additional extended working hours (Hill et al., 1998). According to some studies,
 employees' families found it difficult because workplace and schedule flexibility blurred the lines between work obligations
 and personal life (Klopotek, 2017).
 
 It's necessary to design a separate workstation location that may handle these tendencies because working in one's home 
 might cause distractions. The ease of working remotely might ultimately put you in danger of developing a bad routine that 
 potentially compromises your mental and physical health. Since it might be challenging to cooperate with people across various 
 time zones, location and the time zone difference both play a role in this.
  </p>
  
 <p>
 In a remote workspace, the network and connectivity might provide a problem. A remote workplace cannot be created without a 
 network or a way to connect online. A network will occasionally lose connection due to external factors.
 </p>

 <p>
 Spending too much time alone can be unhealthy, even though social isolation can occasionally be beneficial. 
 Being able to manage your professional hours at home and personal time when you spend them mostly in the same space 
 requires a lot of self-discipline. This has an impact on both physical and mental health since spending the majority 
 of the day alone in a chair looking at a computer is bad. A remote workstation might result in a lack of physical activity 
 in contrast to the typical workspace when you get up and commute outside of your home.
 </p>

<h2> III. Illustrate what the current situation of work is </h2>
<p>
The world of work has been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (International Labour Organization, 2022).
This pandemic has set off one of the worst jobs crises since the Great Depression and there is a real thret that 
this crisis will increase poverty and widen inequalities with the impact felt for years more in the future 
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, n.d.). Now, more than 2 years into the pandemic, 
the world of work is still trying to recover from its unprecedented and long-term impacts.
 </p>
 
 <p>
As of 2022 in the US, remote jobs make up 15% of work opportunities. 26% of employees now work remotely and 16%
of companies are fully remote. It is expected that 36.2 million employees will be working remotely by 2025 (Flynn, 2022).
 </p>
 
 <p>
Remote work or Work-from-Home (WFH) is one of the immidiate responses of industries to keep businesses going when 
the pandemic hit and people cannot interact the way they used to. During the height of the pandemic, close to 70% 
of full-time workers are working from home (Owl Labs, n.d. as cited in Apollo Technical, 2022). And now, 75% of 
global workers believe remote working is the new normal (Phillips, 2022) and a whopping 97% of workers desire 
some form of remote work. Some workers are even pushing against the return of complete full-time onsite job arrangements. For
example, professionals in the Philippine IT and business process management (IT-BPM) industries are considering resignation if
they are not offered location flexibility for their work or at least a hybrid work setup (Chau, 2022). One proposed hybrid work
model is the 70:30 ratio for onsite and work-from-home respectively. This was proposed by the Advisory Council of Experts (ACE)
with hopes of helping the country’s economic stability as everyone adjusts to the new normal (Chau, 2022). 
 </p>
 
 <p>
Remote work has a beneficial effect on employee productivity, reduces real estate costs, and reduces negative environmental impact (Wrike, n.d.).  
It also helps with emergency preparedness and worker satisfaction. Employees have more freedom and flexibility at work because of WFH. 
This enhances building a strong and more optimal workflow system. In addition, it improves the mood of employees 
(makes them happier and more motivated) as they foster a sense of control over balancing their professional and personal lives. 
As a result, their output increased significantly (Arneson, 2021). Given the widespread job loss in the Philippine context,
many Filipino workers would be enticed by the idea of working from home. Afterall, the idea of skipping daily commutes would
bring much convenience given how the country’s capital is globally the eighth worst city in hours spent in traffic (Valmonte, 2022).
Aside from convenience and avoiding the risk of COVID-19, employees save their time and money by working from home.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Furthermore, 56 percent of CEOs anticipate expanding their workspace, while 44 percent anticipate reducing their office space.
This shows that some employers plan to reinvest the remote work dividend in developing a better office experience 
for the next three years (Caglar et al., 2021).
 </p>
 
 <p>
This lean towards remote work is not only seen on the employees but on the side of the employers as well. 
The response to global pandemic has shown that hybrid work models are not necessarily a hindrance to productivity.
 Because of this, there is a general consensus that different WFH models will continue even after COVID-19. 
 Employers see benefits to flexible working arrangements like positive results on employee wellness surveys, and 
 reduction of the need for office space (Sava, 2022). 
</p>

 <div class = "fourth">
<h2> IV. Show how Remote Work Technologies disrupts the current situation </h2>
<p>
    Companies have now realized that physical presence at the office full-time is not necessary to have great
    results. In fact, many companies including prominent brands such as Adobe and Spotify have already 
    switched to hybrid and remote workplaces (Howington, 2022). According to a 2022 AT&T study, the hybrid 
    work model is expected to grow from 42% in 2021 to 81% in 2024. 
</p>

<p>
    Coworking spaces have become popular due to this shift in the way work is done.
    of working. These spaces accomodate people from various companies, acting
    as a community hub for all sorts of office work (Hogarty,2021). This lessens expenses as
    companies no longer need to lease out an office space to do work, as well as it minimizes 
    investments towards transportation and other expenses that otherwise would have occurred for on-site working.
 </p>

<p>
    New technologies have been adopted in order to do work. To communicate,
    teams use video conferencing calls to collaborate in real-time or through
    messaging applications such as Slack and Microsoft Teams. Fast Company 
    predicts that remote work software will become the prefferred over f2f meetings.

    Companies such as Microsoft and Meta are developing virtual meeting spaces with VR technology.
    Video conferencing just feels less personal and less engaging, especially in group settings
    according to Chokkatu(2020). Virtual meeting spaces like Spatial and MeetInVR can help with this.

    To keep track of projects, teams use project management applications to replace the physical 
    the physical boards used to represent a project's progress in office spaces. 

</p>
 
<p>
    As mentioned in previous sections, although Remote Work has its benefits, it is not without its problems. For instance, 
    Chen (2021) states that working from home requires its stakeholders to have the 
    necessary resources to do so, such as the proper virtual  literacies to navigate online, 
    the appropriate gadgets needed to work, and although some organizations do 
    provide their workers with the necessary tools, we also need to consider that the 
    individual will need to occupy space within the household that is optimal for working. 
    Despite its flexibility, we also need to consider that work and household 
    responsibilities can tend to overlap if the employee does not have their own personal
    working space. In regards to communication within the workplace, barriers also 
    emerge as several communication cues are not present; which in turn could lead into problems.
 </p>
 
<p>
  Remote Work Technologies started as a temporary solution during the height of the pandemic and since
  then, they had been established as necessities in workplaces. That being the case, companies like 3M and 
  AirBNB have switched to permanent remote work setup regardless of the pandemic (Howington, 2022.). 
  Further research findings suggest that employees prefer working remotely for various reasons such as 
  better balance, improved productivity, and wariness towards coronavirus exposure (Liu, 2022).
 </p>
  
<p> 
  This disruptive technology prompted organizations to quickly embrace remote work and digital touchpoints 
  (Gartner, n.d.). The latter refers to interactions between customers and businesses that happen online which 
  has become very common now in terms of customer services and reaching out to clients. Such services can be 
  done remotely through chat applications, video call conferencing, and other similar technologies. 
 </p>
  
<p>
  Moreover, remote work technologies have opened up opportunities for freelancers as businesses are more 
  inclined to hire them (Ozimek, n.d.). Local freelancers are now able to take on international clients 
  and easily communicate and address their needs. Freelancing is continuously gaining popularity in the country.
  In fact, recent surveys estimate that there are more than 1.5 million Filipino freelancers signed up in online
  global freelancing platforms (Abadilla, 2022). An additional benefit to the previously mentioned ones is the
  fact that those freelancing for overseas and local clients are earning 57% more hourly compare to those with
  only domestic clients (Piatos, 2022).
 </p>

 <div class = "conclusion">
<h2> V. Conclusion </h2>
<p>
In this study, remote work or Work-from-Home was defined and its role as a disruptive technology was tackled.
 Remote work as a disruptive technology does not just cancel out the physical presence in a specific area of work but also 
 the way work is done.
</p>

<p>
 Many benefits of remote work include lesser commuting time and expense for the employees, less or no office space needed, and
 making it possible to work from anywhere as long as there is internet connection. Co-working spaces also rose from this. 
</p>
 
<p>
But along with its list of benefits, problems also arise from this work set-up. These problems include the difficulty to
 collaborate because of time zones, absence of a reliable routine, internet connectivity, social isolation, and workers not
 having necessary skills, tools, and workspaces at home.
</p>

<p>
Remote work got significantly popular due to the pandemic and is now expected to gain more popularity to both employees and employers.
</p>

<p>
The internet has given us connection and the possibility of communication to and from every part of the planet.
 And much office work just needs workers' collaboration and teamwork, things which the internet can now make possible
 with the connection and communication it provides so it is not shocking how remote work has truly disrupted and, as forecasted,
 will continue to disrupt the world of work.
