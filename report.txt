Remote working, commonly known as work from home or telecommuting (Gartner, 2020), refers to “the practice of an employee working at their home, or in some other place that is not an organization’s usual place of business” (Cambridge Dictionary, 2022). In other words, it allows employees to work flexibly outside their organization to balance their life and career endeavors. It benefits both the employee and the company to achieve greater opportunities and satisfaction. Remote work can be “temporary or permanent, part-time or full-time, occasional or frequent” (Gartner, 2020), depending on the policies of the company. 

The COVID-19 pandemic compelled many individuals to swiftly transition from a traditional face-to-face work environment to a wholly remote workforce. Majority of the population are greatly affected by this phenomenon to prevent the widespread of virus. Because of this occurrence in our lives, remote work changed the way people work, eventually creating a technological disruption. Our group decided to exemplify this topic on our report to tackle its relevance in our situation nowadays and why and how it can be considered disruptive.

## II. Why Remote Work Tech can be considered disruptive ##

## III. Illustrate what the current situation of work is ##
<p>
The world of work has been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (International Labour Organization, 2022). This pandemic has set off one of the worst jobs crises since the Great Depression and there is a real thret that this crisis will increase poverty and widen inequalities with the impact felt for years more in the future (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, n.d.). Now, more than 2 years into the pandemic, the world of work is still trying to recover from its unprecedented and long-term impacts.
<br>
Remote work or Work-from-Home (WFH) is one of the immidiate responses of industries to keep businesses going when the pandemic hit and people cannot interact the way they used to. During the height of the pandemic, close to 70% of full-time workers are working from home (Owl Labs, n.d. as cited in Apollo Technical, 2022). And now, 75% of global workers believe remote working is the new normal (Phillips, 2022) and a whopping 97% of workers desire some form of remote work.
<br>
This lean towards remote work is not only seen on the employees but on the side of the employers as well. The response to global pandemic has shown that hybrid work models are not necessarily a hindrance to productivity. Because of this, there is a general consensus that different WFH models will continue even after COVID-19. Employers see benefits to flexible working arrangements like positive results on employee wellness surveys, and reduction of the need for office space (Sava, 2022).

<br>
<p>
Given the widespread job loss, some Filipino workers would be enticed by the idea of working from home. Afterall, the idea of skipping daily commutes would bring much convenience given how the country’s capital is globally the eighth worst city in hours spent in traffic (Valmonte, 2022). Aside from convenience and avoiding the risk of COVID-19, employees save their time and money by working from home.
<br>
Some workers are pushing against the return of complete full-time onsite job arrangements. Specifically, professionals in the Philippine IT and business process management (IT-BPM) industries are considering resignation if they are not offered location flexibility for their work or at least a hybrid work setup (Chau, 2022). One proposed hybrid work model is the 70:30 ratio for onsite and work-from-home respectively. This was proposed by the Advisory Council of Experts (ACE) with hopes of helping the country’s economic stability as everyone adjusts to the new normal (Chau, 2022). 
<br>
Furthermore, a particular type of remote labor that the Philippines workforce has turned to is freelancing. Unlike the hybrid model, this one is far more geographically flexible. In fact, recent surveys estimate that there are more than 1.5 million Filipino freelancers signed up in online global freelancing platforms (Abadilla, 2022). An additional benefit to the previously mentioned ones is the fact that those freelancing for overseas and local clients are earning 57% more hourly compare to those with only domestic clients (Piatos, 2022).

## IV. Show how Remote Work Technologies disrupts the current situation ##
<p>
According to a 2022 AT&T study, the hybrid work model is expected to grow from 42% in 2021 to 81% in 2024. Companies have now realized that physical presence at the office full-time is not necessary to have great results. In fact, many companies including prominent brands such as Adobe and Spotify have already switched to hybrid and remote workplaces (Howington, 2022).
