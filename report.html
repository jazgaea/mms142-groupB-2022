<h1> Remote Work Technologies: How they disrupt the current work environment <h1>

<h2> I. Introduction </h2>


<!-- Draft lang nman - Reine -->
<p>

 Remote working, commonly known as work from home or telecommuting (Gartner, 2020),
 refers to “the practice of an employee working at their home,
 or in some other place that is not an organization’s usual place of business” (Cambridge Dictionary, 2022). In other words,
 it allows employees to work flexibly outside their organization to balance their life and career endeavors.
 It benefits both the employee and the company to achieve greater opportunities and satisfaction. 
 Remote work can be “temporary or permanent, part-time or full-time, occasional or frequent” (Gartner, 2020),
 depending on the policies of the company.

 The COVID-19 pandemic compelled many individuals to swiftly transition from a traditional face-to-face work 
 environment to a wholly remote workforce. Majority of the population are greatly affected by this phenomenon 
 to prevent the widespread of virus. Because of this occurrence in our lives, remote work changed the way people 
 work, eventually creating a technological disruption. Our group decided to exemplify this topic on our report to 
 tackle its relevance in our situation nowadays and why and how it can be considered disruptive.

<h2> II. Why Remote Work Tech can be considered disruptive </h2>

<h2> III. Illustrate what the current situation of work is </h2>
<p>
The world of work has been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (International Labour Organization, 2022).
This pandemic has set off one of the worst jobs crises since the Great Depression and there is a real thret that 
this crisis will increase poverty and widen inequalities with the impact felt for years more in the future 
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, n.d.). Now, more than 2 years into the pandemic, 
the world of work is still trying to recover from its unprecedented and long-term impacts.
<br>
Remote work or Work-from-Home (WFH) is one of the immidiate responses of industries to keep businesses going when 
the pandemic hit and people cannot interact the way they used to. During the height of the pandemic, close to 70% 
of full-time workers are working from home (Owl Labs, n.d. as cited in Apollo Technical, 2022). And now, 75% of 
global workers believe remote working is the new normal (Phillips, 2022) and a whopping 97% of workers desire 
some form of remote work.
<br>
This lean towards remote work is not only seen on the employees but on the side of the employers as well. 
The response to global pandemic has shown that hybrid work models are not necessarily a hindrance to productivity.
 Because of this, there is a general consensus that different WFH models will continue even after COVID-19. 
 Employers see benefits to flexible working arrangements like positive results on employee wellness surveys, and 
 reduction of the need for office space (Sava, 2022).

<h2> IV. Show how Remote Work Technologies disrupts the current situation </h2>
<p>
According to a 2022 AT&T study, the hybrid work model is expected to grow from 42% in 2021 to 81% in 2024. Companies have now realized that physical presence at the office full-time is not necessary to have great results. In fact, many companies including prominent brands such as Adobe and Spotify have already switched to hybrid and remote workplaces (Howington, 2022).
